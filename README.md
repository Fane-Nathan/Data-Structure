## Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node.

## Double Linked List

A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

## Hashmap

A Hashmap is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Other Data Structures

This section includes other data structures like Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Graphs, Tries, etc.
